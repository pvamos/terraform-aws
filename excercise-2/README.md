# Exercise 2

We have an application that stores data on a filesystem, and our backup policy requires that it stores backups for 180 days and no more. You have selected S3 as the backup storage in a different account.

Your goal is to ensure these backups are stored according to best practices. Please implement an S3 bucket with the appropriate configuration you think of as best practices for this task. Recommended ways to approach the problem are security, cost considerations.

Actually uploading the files as a cron job or something is not part of this exercise, but you have to ensure that the following IAM role is able to upload files into the bucket arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/backup_uploader (its a fake :)).
